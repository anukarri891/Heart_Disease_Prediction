# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction Project
Overview:
The Heart Disease Prediction project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical parameters. By analyzing patient data, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators, the model provides an early warning system for potential heart-related conditions.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Data Processing: Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning, Normalization
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC Curve
Key Features:

Preprocessing of real-world medical datasets
Implementation of multiple machine learning models to compare accuracy
Visualization of data patterns and correlations
Performance evaluation using statistical metrics
Deployment as a web application (if extended using Flask)
Impact:
This project aids in early detection, potentially assisting doctors in diagnosing heart disease more efficiently and helping individuals take preventive measures based on risk assessment.
